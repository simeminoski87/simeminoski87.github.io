        <img src="images/pobeda1.jpg" width="480" height="30%">
        <p>I have played football since I know about myself.Started at very young age playing with my friends on the
        street,we would put rocks to be our goal and bottles to mark the out line.I really enjoyed those days.
        After a litle bit time my father enrolled me in a football academy.At first I was at the bottom quality among
        other kids but later I improved.After I finished Primary School I moved to Prilep to play for Pobeda Football
        Club.In Prilep I spent 4 years,and the last year was really special for me.I had an injury in a pre-seaseon match
        but I recovered before the season started.That was my best season as a professional football player and my
        team finished first meaning that we became Champions of Macedonia for players under the age of 19.</p>
